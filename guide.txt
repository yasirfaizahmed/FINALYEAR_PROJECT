0 : PRIM_RX : Controls the NRF mode [ 1= Receiver ] [ 0 = Transmitter ]

1 : PWR_UP  : Power up control. [1 = Power up]  [0 = Power down]

2 : CRCO : Set CRC encoding scheme. [1 = 2 Bytes]  [0 = 1 Byte] I have a tutorial on CRC here if        you dont know what it is. 

3 : EN_CRC   : Enables the CRC (more on this later) If any channel has Auto Ack enabled the CRC is
also forced to be enabled. 

4 : MASK_MAX_RT : Enables/Disables whether the MAX_RT interrupt drives the IRQ pin

5 : MASK_TX_DS     : Enables/Disables whether the TX_DS interrupt drives the IRQ pin

6 : MASK_RX_DR    :  Enables/Disables whether the RX_DR interrupt drives the IRQ pin

Bits 0 and 1 are pretty self explanatory. Bit 2 controls how many bytes are used for the CRC scheme, basically the NRF will add either 1 or 2 bytes at the end of a transmission when CRC is enabled. And as noted when any channel has auto acknowledge enabled the CRC is forced. 

CRC and auto Ack work in conjunction to make sure data reception is only presented when the data is valid. The NRF will run a CRC algorithm on the address, packet control (if there is one) and your payload. The result of that is a "CRC code"  and it will add that code to the frame format and transmit it along with your data. Then the transmitter will turn itself into a receiver, no code required to do this, and listen for an ACK to verify the data was received.

The receiver will receive the entire frame packet and extract your data and run the same CRC algorithm on it. If the CRC code that results from the receivers CRC engine is the same as the one sent by the transmitter then it means they both ran the same CRC algorithm on the exact same data and thus no bits were lost or modified or noise etc.. therefore the data is valid. 

At this point the receiver will momentarily turn into a transmitter, all on its own no code required, and it will send an ACK command to the transmitter telling it that it received the data. If the CRC codes do not match then the receiver does not send anything and discards the data.
Note that both receiver and transmitter need to have auto ACK enabled for this scheme to work, this is what they call "Enhanced Shockburst".


There are only 11 commands

DPI nature - nature of the SPI protocol, that with every byte you send a byte is sent back. That first byte you get back is not the reply to the command request, but just a dummy byte that needs to be sent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------ command 1 ---------------------------------
command: R_REGISTER
code   : 000xxxxx

The R_REGISTER command is used to Read a register and its opcode is 000xxxxx where the x's represent the address of the register you wish to read. For example if you want to read the contents of the RF_SETUP register which is address 0x06 ( 00000110 ) you would simply join the R_REGISTER command with the RF_SETUP address , which if you look at it ends up being just the RF_SETUP command anywyas.. then you send that through SPI and transmit. Then youll get a dummy byte, you can ignore it, to get your actual reply you need to send a dummy byte also because thats how SPI works and you will get the contents of the RF_SETUP register .

//pseudo code
#define R_REGISTER  0x00
#define RF_SETUP    0x06
spi_send ( R_REGISTER | RF_SETUP) ; 
//the returned byte will be first a dummy byte and then the contents

------------------------------ command 2 ---------------------------------
command: W_REGISTER
code   : 001xxxxx

This is the Write command and you use it to write to a register. Unlike the previous command this is not just leading zeros. The x's represent the address of the register you want to write to. After sending this command the NRF expects the data that is to be written to . The SPI send would look exactly like the previous one except you OR it with W_REGISTER.

//pseudo code
#define W_REGISTER  0x20  // 00100000
#define RF_SETUP    0x06
spi_send ( W_REGISTER | RF_SETUP) ;
spi_send(data)


------------------------------ command 3 ---------------------------------
command: R_RX_PAYLOAD
code   : 01100001
 
The R_RX_PAYLOAD is the command you send when you know you have received data, you will know this because the RX_DR interrupt will have been triggered.  Before you read the payload it makes sense to read STATUS register and check the  RX_P_NO bits to figure out which Pipe this data was received on.
Or if you're only using one pipe it does not matter.
After sending the R_RX_PAYLOAD command the NRF needs to transmit that data to you via SPI and in order to do that you have to send it some dummy bytes, it does not matter what the bytes are it can be 0xF1 or 0xFF... makes no difference,what does make a difference is that you need to send it the number of bytes equal to the data-width that was set in the RX_PW_P# register or alternatively there is a command to check the width of the top most payload.
 Width can be from 1 to 32 bytes



------------------------------ command 4 ---------------------------------
command: W_TX_PAYLOAD
code   : 01000000

This is the command to write your payload. You must make sure that before you start the RF transmission  the CE pin must be LOW. Once you send this command the NRF expects your payload data to come next. Your data width can be from 1 to 32 bytes longs.  After the last byte is sent and you stop the SPI communication you have to bring the CE pin HIGH, because a LOW to HIGH transition is what tells the NRF to transmit what is in the TX FIFO. and this command is what writes in the TX FIFO.


------------------------------ command 5,6 ---------------------------------
command: FLUSH_TX, FLUSH_RX
code   : 11100001, 11100010


These two commands clear the FIFOs, really not much else to be said here aside from the fact that the datasheet says you should not clear the RX FIFO during a transmission of ACK.  Just wait till all transmissions are done before clearing the RX FIFO.


------------------------------ command 7 ---------------------------------
command: REUSE_TX_PL
code   : 11100011

This command allows you to resend the last transmission. You do not need to send W_TX_PAYLOAD.
Simply send this command and it will resend the last packet so long as you have not flushed the FIFO with the commands above this one.



------------------------------ command 8,9 ---------------------------------

command: ACTIVATE, ACTIVATE_BYTE
code   : 01010000, 01110011

This command activates three features at once, not necessarily enables them, but allows them to be used if desired. So its very important. The features it activates are:
1. R_RX_PL_WID read RX payload width when using dynamic payload
2. W_ACK_PAYLOAD allows a payload to be sent with an ack
3. W_TX_PAYLOAD_NOACK disables ack on this specific packet

these three features are described below also. But those commands are useless unless they are activated by this command. 
The command works by first sending the ACTIVATE command, then sending the ACTIVATE_BYTE 
so basically sending 2 SPI send actions, first the ACTIVATE then the ACTIVATE byte.


------------------------------ command 10 ---------------------------------
command: R_RX_PL_WID
code   : 01100000

This command  reads the data width of the top payload in the RX FIFO

------------------------------ command 11 ---------------------------------
command: W_ACK_PAYLOAD
code   : 10101xxx

This command is used to write the payload that will go along with an ACK, when ACK Payloads are enabled in the feature register. After this command the NRF expects the payload data which can be from 1 to 32 bytes.

------------------------------ command 11 ---------------------------------
command: W_TX_PAYLOAD_NO_ACK
code   : 10101xxx

This W_TX_PAYLOAD_NO_ACK command is used to disable auto ACK for the current packet. So you enabled this bit right before sending the W_TX_PAYLOAD command.

------------------------------ command 12 ---------------------------------
command: NOP
code   : 11111111

This is a No Operation command, when you send it the NRF does nothing with it. But since you are sending a byte the SPI has to send one back so the NRF send you the contents of its STATUS register.

Packet Format
	This is Enhanced Shockburst(TM) pakcet format from nordic 
     _________________________________________________________________
    |	Preamble | Address  | Packet control |  Payload	   |    CRC   |
    |	1Byte	 | 3-5bytes |    9bits       |	1-32bytes  | 1-2bytes |
    |____________|__________|________________|_____________|__________|
		  		 /
				/
			       /
			     |/_	
      _________________________________________
     |	Payload lengths | PID control | NO_ACK | 
     |	   8bits        |  2bits      |  1bit  |
     |__________________|_____________|________|




The packet format consists of several fields. Also note that the entire packet of data is transmitted MSB , most significant byte first, and each byte is transmitted LSB least significant bit first. This might sound weird or confusing but do not worry the hardware inside the NRF takes care of all of that behind the scenes for you. 

--------------------------- Preamble --------------------------------------------
Preamble is nothing more then a sequence of 1s and 0s to synchronize the receiver's demodulator to the incoming stream. It is only one byte long, if the first bit in the address is a 1 then the preamble is 10101010, otherwise it is 01010101.

--------------------------- Packet Control --------------------------------------
The packet control section has 3 sections within itself.

1. Payload length is a 6 bit field that tells the receiver the length of the incoming payload This field however is only used when dynamic payload length is enabled. Otherwise the value in RX_PW_P# register is the width of the payload.

2. PID is the packet identification field. It is used to tell the receiver 
whether this packet is new or a re-transmitted packet. That way the receiver knows not to present a re-transmitted packet to the mcu if it has already presented this same packet before. THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CANNOT SEND THE SAME DATA TWICE, this "re-transmit" is more like an error or somehow the ACK was not received by the transmitter and now its re-transmitting the same packet. 

3. NO_ACK this is a bit that tells the receiver that no auto ACK should be used for this packet.




NOTE: Every time you start an SPI communication instance you must drive low the CSN pin, this is the slave select line and makes the NRF start listening in its SPI lines.
